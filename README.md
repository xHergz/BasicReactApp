# :warning: Currently Broken
I foolishly merged to master after a few months of writing this and it doesn't work exactly right. I will be fixing it shortly but thought I'd put a warning here since it is the master branch.
# BasicReactApp
A script that sets up a basic ReactJS web application and directory structure that is ready to open.

# Usage
## Windows
- Run the script from Git Bash from where you want the new application made
  - Without adding script to path: `../path-to-script/BasicReactApp.sh app-name`
  - With adding script to path: `BasicReactApp.sh app-name`
- This will create a folder called app-name with everything you need to get started
